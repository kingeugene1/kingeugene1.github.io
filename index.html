            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently a doctoral student focusing on the concept of (V.B.I.S.I)Vehicle-Bridge Interaction Sytem Identification a drive-by bridge monitoring scheme, a Master and Bachelor of Science degree holder in 
                civil engineering with specialization in structural engineering. I am looking to use my higly sophisticated <strong>mathematical knowledge, problem-solving skills, programming language skills</strong> and so many other of my soft skills
                to help your company to stay top ahead of competitors<strong> as structural health monitoring engineer</strong> in a civil engineering construction and consultant firm. I addition
                I think that <strong> my website development skills </strong>(front-end developer) can be usifull to the company. So why not try me!, I am sure I've got what you need.
